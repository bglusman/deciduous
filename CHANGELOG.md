# Changelog

## [0.3.5] - 2025-12-10

### Fixed
- **Critical: Database path resolution now walks up directory tree** - Previously, `deciduous` used relative paths based on current working directory. Running commands from subdirectories or different directories would use/create a different database, making it appear like data was lost. Now `deciduous` walks up the directory tree to find `.deciduous/` folder, similar to how `git` finds `.git/`. This means:
  - Running `deciduous nodes` from `project/src/` correctly uses `project/.deciduous/deciduous.db`
  - Running commands from any subdirectory of an initialized project works correctly
  - No more "phantom" databases created in wrong directories

### Technical Details
- Modified `get_db_path()` in `src/db.rs` to traverse parent directories
- `DECIDUOUS_DB_PATH` env var still takes priority if set
- If no `.deciduous/` found anywhere up the tree, defaults to current directory (for `deciduous init`)
